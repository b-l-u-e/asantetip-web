            United States) levied by the card network, will be deducted from
            your account balance. You can initiate a dispute resolution process
            by emailing info@asantetip.com, and submit evidence to make your
            case that the payment was valid. If the dispute is found in your
            favor, the disputed amount and fee will be returned back to you. If
            a dispute is upheld, the card issuer’s decision is final and the
